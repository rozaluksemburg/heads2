These are the splashes of color that should appear the most in your UI,
and are the ones that determine the overall "look" of the site. Use these
for things like primary actions, links, navigation items, icons, accent
borders, or text you want to emphasize.

These colors should be used fairly conservatively throughout your UI to
avoid overpowering your primary colors. Use them when you need an
element to stand out, or to reinforce things like error states or positive
trends with the appropriate semantic color.

Primary
These are the splashes of color that should appear the most in your UI,
and are the ones that determine the overall "look" of the site. Use these
for things like primary actions, links, navigation items, icons, accent
borders, or text you want to emphasize.

These colors should be used fairly conservatively throughout your UI to
avoid overpowering your primary colors. Use them when you need an
element to stand out, or to reinforce things like error states or positive
trends with the appropriate semantic color.
