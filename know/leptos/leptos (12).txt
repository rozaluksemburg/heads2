_signal(0);
    // we'll pass the setter to specific components,
    // but provide the count itself to the whole app via context
    provide_context(count);

    view! {
        // SetterButton is allowed to modify the count
        <SetterButton set_count/>
        // These consumers can only read from it
        // But we could give them write access by passing `set_count` if we wanted
        <FancyMath/>
        <ListItems/>
    }
}
<SetterButton/> is the kind of counter we’ve written several times now. (See the sandbox below if you don’t understand what I mean.)

<FancyMath/> and <ListItems/> both consume the signal we’re providing via use_context and do something with it.

/// A component that does some "fancy" math with the global count
#[component]
fn FancyMath() -> impl IntoView {
    // here we consume the global count signal with `use_context`
    let count = use_context::<ReadSignal<u32>>()
        // we know we just provided this in the parent component
        .expect("there to be a `count` signal provided");
    let is_even = move || count() & 1 == 0;

    view! {
        <div class="consumer blue">
            "The number "
            <strong>{count}</strong>
            {move || if is_even() {
                " is"
            } else {
                " is not"
            }}
            " even."
        </div>
    }
}
Note that this same pattern can be applied to more complex state. If you have multiple fields you want to update independently, you can do that by providing some struct of signals:

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
struct GlobalState {
    count: RwSignal<i32>,
    name: RwSignal<String>
}

impl GlobalState {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            count: create_rw_signal(0),
            name: create_rw_signal("Bob".to_string())
        }
    }
}

#[component]
fn App() -> impl IntoView {
    provide_context(GlobalState::new());

    // etc.
}
Option #3: Create a Global State Struct and Slices
You may find it cumbersome to wrap each field of a structure in a separate signal like this. In some cases, it can be useful to create a plain struct with non-reactive fields, and then wrap that in a signal.

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Default)]
struct GlobalState {
    count: i32,
    name: String
}

#[component]
fn App() -> impl IntoView {
    provide_context(create_rw_signal(GlobalState::default()));

    // etc.
}
But there’s a problem: because our whole state is wrapped in one signal, updating the value of one field will cause reactive updates in parts of the UI that only depend on the other.

let state = expect_context::<RwSignal<GlobalState>>();
view! {
    <button on:click=move |_| state.update(|state| state.count += 1)>"+1"</button>
    <p>{move || state.with(|state| state.name.clone())}</p>
}
In this example, clicking the button will cause the text inside <p> to be updated, cloning state.name again! Because signals are the atomic unit of reactivity, updating any field of the signal triggers updates to everything that depends on the signal.

There’s a better way. You can take fine-grained, reactive slices by using create_memo or create_slice (which uses create_memo but also provides a setter). “Memoizing” a value means creating a new reactive value which will only update when it changes. “Memoizing a slice” means creating a new reactive value which will only update when some field of the state struct updates.

Here, instead of reading from the state signal directly, we create “slices” of that state with fine-grained updates via create_slice. Each slice signal only updates when the particular piece of the larger struct it accesses updates. This means you can create a single root signal, and then take independent, fine-grained slices of it in different components, each of which can update without notifying the others of changes.

/// A component that updates the count in the global state.
#[component]
fn GlobalStateCounter() -> impl IntoView {
    let state = expect_context::<RwSignal<GlobalState>>();

    // `create_slice` lets us create a "lens" into the data
    let (count, set_count) = create_slice(

        // we take a slice *from* `state`
        state,
        // our getter returns a "slice" of the data
        |state| state.count,
        // our setter describes how to mutate that slice, given a new value
        |state, n| state.count = n,
    );

    view! {
        <div class="consumer blue">
            <button
                on:click=move |_| {
                    set_count(count() + 1);
                }
            >
                "Increment Global Count"
            </button>
            <br/>
            <span>"Count is: " {count}</span>
        </div>
    }
}
Clicking this button only updates state.count, so if we create another slice somewhere else that only takes state.name, clicking the button won’t cause that other slice to update. This allows you to combine the benefits of a top-down data flow and of fine-grained reactive updates.

Note: There are some significant drawbacks to this approach. Both signals and memos need to own their values, so a memo will need to clone the field’s value on every change. The most natural way to manage state in a framework like Leptos is always to provide signals that are as locally-scoped and fine-grained as they can be, not to hoist everything up into global state. But when you do need some kind of global state, create_slice can be a useful tool.

use leptos::*;

// So far, we've only been working with local state in components
// We've only seen how to communicate between parent and child components
// But there are also more general ways to manage global state
//
// The three best approaches to global state are
// 1. Using the router to drive global state via the URL
// 2. Passing signals through context
// 3. Creating a global state struct and creating lenses into it with `create_slice`
//
// Option #1: URL as Global State
// The next few sections of the tutorial will be about the router.
// So for now, we'll just look at options #2 and #3.

// Option #2: Pass Signals through Context
//
// In virtual DOM libraries like React, using the Context API to manage global
// state is a bad idea: because the entire app exists in a tree, changing
// some value provided high up in the tree can cause the whole app to render.
//
// In fine-grained reactive libraries like Leptos, this is simply not the case.
// You can create a signal in the root of your app and pass it down to other
// components using provide_context(). Changing it will only cause rerendering
// in the specific places it is actually used, not the whole app.

fn Option2() -> impl IntoView {
    // here we create a signal in the root that can be consumed
    // anywhere in the app.
    let (count, set_count) = create_signal(0);

    // but provide the count itself to the whole app via context
    provide_context(count);

The Basics
Routing drives most websites. A router is the answer to the question, “Given this URL, what should appear on the page?”

A URL consists of many parts. For example, the URL https://my-cool-blog.com/blog/search?q=Search#results consists of

a scheme: https
a domain: my-cool-blog.com
a path: /blog/search
a query (or search): ?q=Search
a hash: #results
The Leptos Router works with the path and query (/blog/search?q=Search). Given this piece of the URL, what should the app render on the page?

The Philosophy
In most cases, the path should drive what is displayed on the page. From the user’s perspective, for most applications, most major changes in the state of the app should be reflected in the URL. If you copy and paste the URL and open it in another tab, you should find yourself more or less in the same place.

In this sense, the router is really at the heart of the global state management for your application. More than anything else, it drives what is displayed on the page.

The router handles most of this work for you by mapping the current location to particular components.


Defining Routes
Getting Started
It’s easy to get started with the router.

First things first, make sure you’ve added the leptos_router package to your dependencies. Like leptos, the router relies on activating a csr, hydrate, or ssr feature. For example, if you’re adding the router to a client-side rendered app, you’ll want to run

cargo add leptos_router --features=csr 
It’s important that the router is a separate package from leptos itself. This means that everything in the router can be defined in user-land code. If you want to create your own router, or use no router, you’re completely free to do that!

And import the relevant types from the router, either with something like

use leptos_router::{Route, RouteProps, Router, RouterProps, Routes, RoutesProps};
or simply

use leptos_router::*;
Providing the <Router/>
Routing behavior is provided by the <Router/> component. This should usually be somewhere near the root of your application, the rest of the app.

You shouldn’t try to use multiple <Router/>s in your app. Remember that the router drives global state: if you have multiple routers, which one decides what to do when the URL changes?

Let’s start with a simple <App/> component using the router:

use leptos::*;
use leptos_router::*;

#[component]
pub fn App() -> impl IntoView {
  view! {
    <Router>
      <nav>
        /* ... */
      </nav>
      <main>
        /* ... */
      </main>
    </R
